ðŸ“Œ 2. Overall Summary of What We Achieved
ðŸ”¹ Core Features Implemented
âœ… 1. Payment Processing Logic

When a payment is made, we automatically create a Financial Transaction for it.
We ensure that Financial Transactions are linked to Payments and Invoices.
âœ… 2. Overpayment Prevention

Payments cannot exceed the Invoiceâ€™s total amount.
We implemented validation logic that checks past payments and prevents overpayments using addError().
âœ… 3. Trigger Handler Design Pattern

We refactored the trigger to use a separate handler class (PaymentTransactionHandler).
The handler:
Fetches Invoice details.
Fetches Total Paid Amount using Aggregate SOQL.
Validates payments before inserting transactions.
âœ… 4. Bulk Processing & Performance Optimizations

Used Maps & Sets for faster lookups.
Used Aggregate SOQL to optimize total paid amount calculations.
Ensured bulk-safe operations to handle multiple payments at once.
