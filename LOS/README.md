Once you have this model in place, you can practice various Apex concepts:

Loan Application Trigger

Trigger on Loan__c that auto-calculates the Monthly_Payment__c based on Principal_Amount__c, Interest_Rate__c, and Term_Months__c.
Could be a before insert/before update trigger that updates Monthly_Payment__c whenever the principal, interest rate, or term changes.
Auto-Creation of Payment Schedules

When a loan is set to “Active,” automatically create 12 or more Payment__c records (one for each month).
You can store projected payment dates, amounts, etc.
Ensure you handle bulk scenarios (e.g., multiple Loan__c records at once).
Batch Apex for Aging Loans

A Batch Apex class that runs nightly and checks for loans that are past due.
If a loan’s due date or end date is exceeded, mark the loan as “Overdue” or send an email alert to the Contact.
Example: after 30 days of non-payment, send a reminder or update a custom field to track delinquencies.
Demographic Scoring or Approval

A trigger or Apex class that evaluates Demographic_Information__c (e.g., if Age__c < 18, reject the loan, or if Annual_Income__c < some threshold, mark it for manual approval).
Integrate with an Approval Process in Salesforce or a Flow.
REST Apex for Loan Creation

Expose an Apex REST endpoint to allow external systems (like a banking portal) to create a new Loan__c record for an existing Contact.
The endpoint could handle JSON that includes principal amount, interest rate, contact ID, etc.
Scheduled Payment Processing

A scheduled Apex class that runs monthly to check for Payment__c records due that month.
Could automatically update Loan__c.Outstanding_Balance__c based on posted payments or create tasks for collectors if no payment is received.
LWC Integration

Build a Lightning Web Component to display a list of Loans for the current user’s customers.
Allow inline editing or quick actions (e.g., mark a payment as received).
Use Apex with @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) to fetch data.
